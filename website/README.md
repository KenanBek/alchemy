# Alchemy Website
The source for `alchemy.rs`, which is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## To Edit...
This website is a static site, backed by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/). You'll need to install it to develop it locally. Otherwise... have at it.

If you make substantial changes, make sure the build command outputs to the proper directory:

```
zola build --output-dir /path/to/alchemy/docs/folder
```
