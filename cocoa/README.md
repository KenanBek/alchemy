# Alchemy-Cocoa
This crate implements a backend for Cocoa-based widgets, such as `NSView`, `NSTextField`, and so on. Note that while it's under development currently, the fate of AppKit is still kind of a gray area. If Apple ends up pushing Marzipan as "the" solution, it's possible this might become obsolete, or would run in tandem with the iOS crate for iOS/Marzipan.
